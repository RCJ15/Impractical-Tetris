# Impractical Tetris
Tetris with any possible shape, not just squares.

[Sub to my YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXDxyxrKwSWp1rbv-WUjsEQ) since I'm gonna be doing a devlog video.

## How To Open The Project
Hey did you know that this game is on Github? Wow that means you can download the source code and start doing whatever you want with the game. Very cool right?
Here is how to do that:

**Step 1**
Make sure you have Unity 2021.3.1f1 downloaded & installed (you can obviously use another version but this is the version I used).

**Step 2**
Download or clone the repository to your local device. Remember where you saved the project and make sure it's unzipped but you probably already know to do that.

**Step 3**
Open Unity Hub.

**Step 4**
Press "Add" on the projects tab in Unity Hub, then find where you saved the project and add the folder to Unity Hub.

**Step 5**
Open the project and wait for it to load.

**Step 6**
You're now done.

## Game Plan
These things below are what I plan on creating for this game.
- Physics based Tetris gameplay.
- Any shape you can imagine in Tetris (with a system to allow for even more stupid shapes)
- Like 1 original track for this garbage game.
- A main menu.
- A pause menu.
- High score stuff.
- Youtube video???
